| Urban Setting | Urban | | Visual (Before) | Low | Urban, Suburban, Rural | Assess density and proximity to neighbors in "Before" satellite view. |
| Building Position | Mid-block | | Map/Visual | Low | Corner, Mid-block, End-of-block | Determine position relative to intersections from map data. |
| Material (Vertical) | Red Brick | | Visual (Before) | Low | Primary Wall Material (Brick, Stone, etc.) | Identify the primary facade load-bearing material. |
| Material (Horizontal) | Timber | | Visual (After) | Moderate | Primary Floor Material (Timber, Concrete, etc.) | Extract from recon reports; often timber in older historic buildings. |
| EF-Rating (Local) | EF3 | | NOAA DAT | Moderate | EF0, EF1, EF2, EF3, EF4 | Use NWS/NOAA DAT coordinates to find local intensity at the site. |
| Mechanism of Failure | | Out-of-Plane | Visual (After) | Low | Global, Out-of-Plane, Roof-First, Secondary Element | Roof-First = Walls stand, roof missing; Out-of-Plane = Masonry wall collapsed. |
| Roof System | Timber Truss | | Visual (After) | Moderate | Timber Truss, Heavy Masonry, Steel, Hybrid | Determine based on recon notes or debris visibility in "After" photos. |
| Roof Shape & Slope | Flat / Low | | Visual (Before) | Low | Flat, Gable, Hip, Mansard; High, Med, Low slope | Analyze geometry from top-down or oblique aerial views. |
| Roof-Wall Attachment | Unknown | | N/A | High | Toe-Nail, Bolts, Straps, Hurricane Clips, Unknown | Crucial for "Roof-First" failures; check recon/FAST reports. |

| Wall Damage (N,S,E,W) | | Severe (North) | Visual (After) | Low | Undamaged, Minor, Moderate, Severe, Destroyed | Assess each facade separately; look for cracks, bowing, or collapse. |
| Wall Structure Damage | | Collapse of upper story | Visual (After) | Low | Damage to structural wythes (N,S,E,W) | Identifies if the load-bearing mass failed vs. just surface finish. |
| Substrate/Cladding | | N/A (Standard Brick) | Visual (After) | Low | Damage to veneer/outer wythe (N,S,E,W) | Identifies surface-only damage (e.g., loss of brick face or siding). |
